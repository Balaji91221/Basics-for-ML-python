# Installation
To run the code in this repository, you will need to install Python 3 and several Python libraries, including NumPy and Pandas. You can install these libraries using the following command:


pip install numpy pandas

# Usage
Each day's code is contained in a separate Jupyter Notebook file. To run a notebook, simply open it in Jupyter and execute the code cells. The notebooks are designed to be self-contained, so you should be able to run them without any additional setup.
